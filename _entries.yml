    This was very good wrestling. Finally got to see Chris Hero live, along with Ricochet and Cody Rhodes (who had a way better match than I was expecting).

    Got a really incredible seat for this at the last moment. The NXT roster's still pretty stacked right now even if the TV show is a bit stale, so every match was pretty great. Surprise of the night was a super good match between Oney Lorcan and Elias Samson?

    I went in this show with a slight bit of cynicism. I love me some synthpop, but it's an easy genre to burn out on in this city, and having already seen The Juan MacLean and Holy Ghost recently, I wasn't sure I needed more of it. But I'm in love with the new Empress Of record, so I figured it was worth checking out her live show, and I'm glad I did.

    She had far more stage presence than I expected of a relatively new artist, and her voice sounded better live than it did on the record. The added live percussion added a lot of warmth to otherwise-cold production, and the whole thing just felt way more uptempo and cheery than I expected. It was a relatively short set (after all, her only album is only half an hour long), but I left looking forward to seeing her again in the future - though I have a feeling that'll be at a much larger venue.

    This may actually be the best show I see this year. I saw Yonatan Gat open for Of Montreal earlier this year, and he completely blew me away, so I figured it was worth seeing him headline. I wasn't disappointed.

    First, the openers. Sunwatchers was a great, drone-y jazz/punk band. This kind of stuff usually fails to land with me, but they had me entranced during their set. [Their first album](http://sunwatchers.bandcamp.com/album/tomb-howl) is worth a listen, particularly the first track, which is a new fav.

    As for Innove Gnawa Band, well, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwtGNq6Evv8) will explain what they're about better than I can. I didn't bother to look up any of the openers before going, so they were a *surprising* discovery, to say the least. I wish more concerts had openers that introduced me to entirely new genres of music, let alone entirely different cultures. They were absolutely wonderful to watch.

    And, well, Yonatan Gat, *wow*. As when they opened for Of Montreal, he and his band performed in the center of the pit. I ended up a few rows back, in a spot just well-positioned enough that I could get glimpses of them between the rest of the audience, which is an oddly appropriate way to experience his music. His set was an unrelenting hour of jamming, the highlight being the last few songs, when Innove Gnawa Band performed backup percussion and vocals (standing directly in front of me, I should add, as can be seen in the video I took). It's rare that you get to feel that *close* to someone's performance.

    Second time seeing The Juan MacLean this year, and, surprise surprise, I still love them. They played a bit of a weird set this time around, though. When I saw them at Cameo earlier this year, they were practicing playing their new record for the first time, and I remember them going through a lot of tracks (though unfortunately I can't find a setlist to confirm). This time around, they only played eight or nine tracks, which made the hour-long set feel far-too-short. Somewhat sad, unanswered chant of "one more song!" after the encore.

    Fortunately, the openers made up for it. The first, HIEDEMANN, was worth getting to the venue early for. She has a fantastic voice, and while her set may have been pretty sparse (she performed solo, playing a few synths and a bass guitar), it was captivating.

    Guerilla Toss is a *strange* punk group that I fell in love with immediately. Their lead singer reminds me a lot of Perfect Pussy's Meredith Graves. Their music, though, is far less noisy and far more danceable. [Their newest EP](https://guerillatoss.bandcamp.com/) is worth checking out, but I don't think it gets across their live sound very well. Their studio material is a lot more difficult to get into, I think, but live, they had no trouble getting people dancing. Hoping their upcoming LP (they just signed to DFA) captures them a bit better. In the meantime, I've already got tickets to see them headline next week at Shea.

    This show was at a cool metal bar up in Greenpoint I'd been meaning to check out. Place ended up being great, even if it's a bit of a hike from the G (not nearly as long a walk as Baby's from the L, though).

    I'd never been that impressed with Speedy Ortiz on record, but took a gamble on this show since it was $5, and they sound *so much better* live that I'm glad I did. Really dug their opener, Aye Nako, too.

    I don't really know how to do "clubs," so I bought a ticket to this with a bit of trepedation. It ended up being worth it - Good Room is a cool place, and their sound system is fantastic.

    The secret live guest for this show was unannounced, and I was super happy to find out it was Holy Ghost!, one of the first bands I ever saw in NYC. Last time I saw them, it was at Terminal 5, and getting to see them in such an intimate setting was real treat. Their stage was set up *opposite* the front of the dance floor, where *James goddamn Murphy* had been DJing, so as soon as I realized they were setting up I pushed my way across the floor to get a good spot.

    They didn't play anything new, which bummed me out a bit (it's been two years since their last record!), but they still sound great and have a killer live setup.

    I hadn't planned on going to this, but between a better-than-expected SummerSlam and my last chance for a while to see main-roster WWE live, plus it being my birthday, I splurged on a decent lower bowl ticket. I was happy to find I had an aisle seat next to the exit, meaning I could easily duck out for more $12(!) beers during Raw's many commercial breaks.

    This was a far better show than I expected from Raw, other than a really depressing-to-watch Divas match with zero heat (especially after the solid-to-amazing women's matches at TakeOver). Seeing The New Day come out with Xavier Woods on a trombone, John Cena AA Jon Stewart, and STING OUT OF NOWHERE made this more than worth it.

    I'd gotten into wrestling by watching last year's SummerSlam, so it seemed oddly appropriate that this year's SummerSlam would be happening a few G train stops away from me. While there was no way in hell I was going to shell out $400+ for SummerSlam, I was more than happy to pay a little under half of that for TakeOver.

    From my floor seat, I couldn't see the ring particularly well, but I did luck out by being incredibly close to the entrance ramp. It was an awesome show, and the crowd noise in that room was incredible. I hadn't been to Barclays Center before, and I was glad to see they had nearly the capacity of MSG in a seemingly much-smaller space - every seat in the house seemed like it'd be a good one.

    I don't listen to a ton of metal, but I fucking *love* Pallbearer. The atmosphere they create on their records is awesome and terrifying. If a band like Mastodon makes the kind of metal that's played during the battle for the end of the world, Pallbearer is the music that's played when the last human alive surveys the carnage.

    This kind of vibe is hard to translate to a concert, of course. And I don't know, short of a ridiculous stage show there's not a lot you could do to recreate that vibe live. But it was still a fantastic set. It was immensely cathartic, just getting pummeled by sound for 50 minutes, and I was glad to be front and center(ish) for it.

    I wasn't super familiar with the rest of the bill beforehand, but was pleasantly surprised. Lucifer played some great hard rock in the vein of Black Sabbath/Deep Purple, and High on Fire played an *exhausting* hour and a half set of fast sludgey stuff.

    Went to this on a whim because I live near the venue, and it was pretty good. My ears generally can't take hours of metal-volume music (really need to invest in some ear plugs), so the most memorable part of this show ended up being when I ducked out to the bar and ate some brussels sprouts during the second opener.

    I know it might sound lame to have the most memorable moment of a concert being brussels sprouts, but y'all, they were *super good*.

    PC Music again! This time, in a far less crazy environment. This was just a solid set of DJs.

    I was super excited to find The Range had been added to the bill. I recognized the name when I saw the set list, but couldn't place it until he played one of my favorite tracks, "The One," which is an absolute gem.

    I don't remember a ton of the PC Music sets, other than that they were very good, and I had a lot of fun dancing. I do remember both AG Cook and Danny L Harle had similar graphics to what they were using at Pop Cube, but the sets seemed a tad more experimental. They used the longer lengths of their sets mostly to tease out their biggest tracks.

    Also, at one point, I danced with [QT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_(musician)), which blew my goddamn mind. She was moving through the crowd like some kind of alien party magician, dancing with everyone, and I loved it.

Turns out, there was a guy sitting behind me who also posted on this forum, and saw my post, and so we ended up hanging out for the whole show! He knew a lot more about the TNA roster than I did, so that worked out well for me. We also ended up getting moved to really good seats that were probably $50-60 online. Thank god TNA is such an unpopular promotion. \n\nI legitimately enjoyed this. Like, I unironically love wrestling, the big dumb spectacle it is, but TNA is *bad* wrestling, at least on TV. In person, though, it's a lot easier to just laugh at the bad booking (aka \"writing\") and appreciate the in-ring action. There were lots of impressive performances by wrestlers I hadn't seen before (Low Ki, Kurt Angle, the Hardys), and I ended up marking out for things that I would probably make fun of if I saw them on TV."

  title: Disclosure / TNGHT / Julio Bashmore
  location: Central Park SummerStage
  body: "WOOOOOW what a show this was. I think the bill mostly speaks for itself; I'm not sure I'll ever see a better lineup in one night. The place went insane when TNGHT dropped Blood on the Leaves, as it had *just* come out. \n\nDisclosure was great, and had both Sam Smith (pre-fame) and Jesse Ware. I ended up hanging out with a group of very high dudes for a while, and harmonized on Latch at the end of the show with them :3"

  title: 4Knots Music Festival
  location: South St Seaport
  body: "This was a weird outdoor festival at a seaport. I spent the better part of a day there, since White Lung went on at 3 and The Men went on at 7, and those were the two bands I was mostly interested in seeing. My roommate at the time showed up, and I randomly ran into my friend from Hacker School, so it was a good time. \n\nWhite Lung was awesome to see, but the crowd was totally dead, since no one wants to mosh in 90 degree weather at 3 in the afternoon. Still, I was excited just to get to say I'd seen them live, since they were only playing in 21-and-over venues and I was still underage. \n\nI don't really remember the rest of the sets too much. I remember being kind of bored with Kurt Vile, and while I liked The Men's big singles, I wasn't impressed with their quieter stuff. I still sort of feel that way, though if it catches me in the right mood, I can really appreciate their ballads."

  title: Anamanaguchi / Pictureplane / Hot Sugar
  location: Irving Plaza
  body: "I don't remember a lot about this show. I went because some Hacker School friends were going, but I'm not really a huge Anamanagchi fan - I like the whole chiptune thing, but they just don't do it for me. However, I do remember liking their show a lot because it just became a whirring blur of poppy synths at some point, and that was very easy to dance to. I also remember one of the openers having some of the weirdest projected visuals ever, freaky GIFs and strange YouTubes. Interesting night."

  location: Santos Party House
  body: "I almost forgot I saw this show! It was cool. I hadn't really listened to their second album much by the time I saw this show, but walked away liking it a lot more than I did the first time I listened to it. Also, Bohemean Rhapsody was cool. \n\nYBR was a cool surprise; I still listen to their album on Spotify occasionally."

  location: 285 Kent
  body: 'This was my first concert in NYC, and it was ridiculous and awesome. There were like three openers, and by the time Andrew came out on stage, he was plastered. He ended up playing an hour set of him banging on a keyboard while going in and out of "Party Hard." Totally awesome. I went with several cool people from Hacker School, some of whom I still hang out with today!'

  location: The Tabernacle (Atlanta, GA)
  body: "This was like the first actual concert I ever went to. It was cool. The Tabernacle is a super dope venue and I'd love to go back for another show sometime. I wish NYC had venues like that - Terminal 5 is sorta close, but their balcony isn't nearly as awesome. \n\n(update: after I originally wrote this entry, I went to my first show at Webster Hall, which is similarly pretty, but not nearly as awesome in general)"
