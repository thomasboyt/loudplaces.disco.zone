    This show was at a cool metal bar up in Greenpoint I'd been meaning to check out. Place ended up being great, even if it's a bit of a hike from the G (not nearly as long a walk as Baby's from the L, though).

    I'd never been that impressed with Speedy Ortiz on record, but took a gamble on this show since it was $5, and they sound *so much better* live that I'm glad I did. Really dug their opener, Aye Nako, too.

    I don't really know how to do "clubs," so I bought a ticket to this with a bit of trepedation. It ended up being worth it - Good Room is a cool place, and their sound system is fantastic.

    The secret live guest for this show was unannounced, and I was super happy to find out it was Holy Ghost!, one of the first bands I ever saw in NYC. Last time I saw them, it was at Terminal 5, and getting to see them in such an intimate setting was real treat. Their stage was set up *opposite* the front of the dance floor, where *James goddamn Murphy* had been DJing, so as soon as I realized they were setting up I pushed my way across the floor to get a good spot.

    They didn't play anything new, which bummed me out a bit (it's been two years since their last record!), but they still sound great and have a killer live setup.

    I hadn't planned on going to this, but between a better-than-expected SummerSlam and my last chance for a while to see main-roster WWE live, plus it being my birthday, I splurged on a decent lower bowl ticket. I was happy to find I had an aisle seat next to the exit, meaning I could easily duck out for more $12(!) beers during Raw's many commercial breaks.

    This was a far better show than I expected from Raw, other than a really depressing-to-watch Divas match with zero heat (especially after the solid-to-amazing women's matches at TakeOver). Seeing The New Day come out with Xavier Woods on a trombone, John Cena AA Jon Stewart, and STING OUT OF NOWHERE made this more than worth it.

    I'd gotten into wrestling by watching last year's SummerSlam, so it seemed oddly appropriate that this year's SummerSlam would be happening a few G train stops away from me. While there was no way in hell I was going to shell out $400+ for SummerSlam, I was more than happy to pay a little under half of that for TakeOver.

    From my floor seat, I couldn't see the ring particularly well, but I did luck out by being incredibly close to the entrance ramp. It was an awesome show, and the crowd noise in that room was incredible. I hadn't been to Barclays Center before, and I was glad to see they had nearly the capacity of MSG in a seemingly much-smaller space - every seat in the house seemed like it'd be a good one.

    I don't listen to a ton of metal, but I fucking *love* Pallbearer. The atmosphere they create on their records is awesome and terrifying. If a band like Mastodon makes the kind of metal that's played during the battle for the end of the world, Pallbearer is the music that's played when the last human alive surveys the carnage.

    This kind of vibe is hard to translate to a concert, of course. And I don't know, short of a ridiculous stage show there's not a lot you could do to recreate that vibe live. But it was still a fantastic set. It was immensely cathartic, just getting pummeled by sound for 50 minutes, and I was glad to be front and center(ish) for it.

    I wasn't super familiar with the rest of the bill beforehand, but was pleasantly surprised. Lucifer played some great hard rock in the vein of Black Sabbath/Deep Purple, and High on Fire played an *exhausting* hour and a half set of fast sludgey stuff.

    Hot Chip is a band I've loved for a long time. "Ready For the Floor" was my ringtone for like a year on my first cell phone. I was ecstatic to finally get to see them live.

    Highlight was their encore, when they did a cover of Bruce Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark" mixed with a verse from LCD Soundsystem's "All My Friends." I, uh, may have cried.

    Went to this on a whim because I live near the venue, and it was pretty good. My ears generally can't take hours of metal-volume music (really need to invest in some ear plugs), so the most memorable part of this show ended up being when I ducked out to the bar and ate some brussels sprouts during the second opener.

    I know it might sound lame to have the most memorable moment of a concert being brussels sprouts, but y'all, they were *super good*.

    PC Music again! This time, in a far less crazy environment. This was just a solid set of DJs.

    I was super excited to find The Range had been added to the bill. I recognized the name when I saw the set list, but couldn't place it until he played one of my favorite tracks, "The One," which is an absolute gem.

    I don't remember a ton of the PC Music sets, other than that they were very good, and I had a lot of fun dancing. I do remember both AG Cook and Danny L Harle had similar graphics to what they were using at Pop Cube, but the sets seemed a tad more experimental. They used the longer lengths of their sets mostly to tease out their biggest tracks.
    
    Also, at one point, I danced with [QT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_(musician)), which blew my goddamn mind. She was moving through the crowd like some kind of alien party magician, dancing with everyone, and I loved it.

In the encore, he ended up taking requests, and ended up doing some of my favorite bits. I also got to stand up and shake the dude's hand at the end, which was awesome. \n\nAlso, Carnegie Hall is beautiful and I should try to go to more shows there."

We all have our stupid hobbies. \n\nThe most ridiculous part of this - and there were many ridiculous parts, because *wrestling* - was that when I took my initial seat, I posted a picture of it on a forum saying that it was what was available for $20. Turns out, there was a guy sitting behind me who also posted on this forum, and saw my post, and so we ended up hanging out for the whole show! He knew a lot more about the TNA roster than I did, so that worked out well for me. We also ended up getting moved to really good seats that were probably $50-60 online. Thank god TNA is such an unpopular promotion. \n\nI legitimately enjoyed this. Like, I unironically love wrestling, the big dumb spectacle it is, but TNA is *bad* wrestling, at least on TV. In person, though, it's a lot easier to just laugh at the bad booking (aka \"writing\") and appreciate the in-ring action. There were lots of impressive performances by wrestlers I hadn't seen before (Low Ki, Kurt Angle, the Hardys), and I ended up marking out for things that I would probably make fun of if I saw them on TV."
